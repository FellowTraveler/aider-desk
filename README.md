## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9-3.12 installed on your system

### Quick Start
1. Download the latest release for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/hotovo/aider-desk/releases)
2. Run the downloaded executable

### Troubleshooting

#### Python Version Detection

If you encounter issues with the application not detecting the correct Python version, you can specify the path to the desired Python executable using the `AIDER_DESK_PYTHON` environment variable. This is typically only needed on the initial run/setup of AiderDesk.

For example, on macOS or Linux:

```bash
export AIDER_DESK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.10
```

Or on Windows:

```powershell
$env:AIDER_DESK_PYTHON = "C:\Path\To\Python310\python.exe"
```

Replace `/usr/bin/python3.10` or `C:\Path\To\Python310\python.exe` with the actual path to your Python executable.
